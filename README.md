# JavaScript Guild's Christmas Card Challenge

The challenge is to create a JavaScript-powered Christmas card. You can use any JavaScript technologies you like, and beyond that you’re free to build whatever you want. Your imagination is the only limit!

This repository contains an example Christmas card that you can also clone and modify into your own creation if you wish.

You can create your card in advance during your own free time, but there will also be time to create one during the JavaScript Guild's event PikkuJSoulut on 9.12.2025.

The card can run locally on your machine, or you may use an online environment such as CodeSandbox or any similar tool.

You can present your card directly from your own computer or from the online environment you chose. There is no requirement to host or deploy it anywhere.

Participants will vote for the winners. Prizes will be awarded in the following categories:

- Funniest Card

- Best Design

- Technologically Most Impressive

Have fun experimenting, and feel free to build something as simple or as ambitious as you like!
