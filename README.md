# JavaScript Guild's Christmas Card Challenge

This repository contains one example Christmas card and basic instructions to help you get started. You may use any JavaScript approach or technology.

You can create your card in advance during your own free time, but there will also be time to create one during the JavaScript Guild's event PikkuJSoulut on 9.12.2025. You can present your card directly from your own computer, so there is no requirement to host or deploy it.

Participants will vote for the winners. Prizes will be awarded in the following categories:

- Funniest Card

- Best Design

- Technologically Most Impressive

Have fun experimenting, and feel free to build something as simple or as ambitious as you like.
